<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Sentinel Configuration, Investigation & KQL Labs</h2>

- <b> KQL Lab </b>
  - [KQL Investigation](https://github.com/Muts256/Valdorian-Scandal)

This lab aims to provide answers to a data breach on a reputable Newspaper. On the eve of the election, Nene Leaks, the esteemed editor of The Valdorian Times, awoke to a nightmare. The Valdorian Times, the beacon of truth for the city, published a scandalous article accusing Luffy of corruption and misconduct. The article, a vile concoction of lies, was not what she had approved.

Objective:
  - To enhance practical skills using a Sentinel.
  - Installation and configuration of Sentinel, Log Analytics workspace.
  - Search for anomalies/unusual behaviour in the logs using KQL
  - Importing log files into Sentinel.
  - Creating an incident alert using  a scheduled rule.
  - Assigning and resolving alerts.
  - Using data connectors to connect to threat intelligence feeds to enrich the investigation process
  - Document the findings. See the Sentinel PDF (SOC Lab Honeyney.pdf) attached above.

Lessons Learned:
  - Configure Cyber Threat Intelligence feeds to enhance detection accuracy, Proactive defence.
  - Configure Sentinel, Log Analytics workspaces, and Analytic rules
  - Using the KQL to filter noise for quick investigation.
  - The value of centralised monitoring.
  - Incident handling workflow
