<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Sentinel Configuration, Investigation & KQL Labs</h2>

- <b> Sentinel </b>
  - [KQL Investigation](https://github.com/Muts256/Valdorian-Scandal)

This lab aims to simulate a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment by deploying a honeynet in Microsoft Azure, forwarding security logs into Microsoft Sentinel, and detecting a brute force attack in real time. The project demonstrates the end-to-end SOC workflow, including log ingestion, threat detection using KQL queries, incident creation and investigation, and enrichment with external threat intelligence sources such as Pulsedive.

Objective:
  - To enhance practical skills using a Sentinel.
  - Installation and configuration of Sentinel, Log Analytics workspace.
  - Search for anomalies/unusual behaviour in the logs using KQL
  - Importing log files into Sentinel.
  - Creating an incident alert using  a scheduled rule.
  - Assigning and resolving alerts.
  - Using data connectors to connect to threat intelligence feeds to enrich the investigation process
  - Document the findings. See the Sentinel PDF (SOC Lab Honeyney.pdf) attached above.

Lessons Learned:
  - Configure Cyber Threat Intelligence feeds to enhance detection accuracy, Proactive defence.
  - Configure Sentinel, Log Analytics workspaces, and Analytic rules
  - Using the KQL to filter noise for quick investigation.
  - The value of centralised monitoring.
  - Incident handling workflow
