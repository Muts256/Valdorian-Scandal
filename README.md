<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Sentinel Configuration, Investigations & KQL Labs</h2>

- <b> KQL Lab </b>
  - [KQL Investigation](https://github.com/Muts256/Valdorian-Scandal)

This lab aims to provide answers to a data breach on a reputable Newspaper. On the eve of the election, Nene Leaks, the esteemed editor of The Valdorian Times, awoke to a nightmare. The Valdorian Times, the beacon of truth for the city, published a scandalous article accusing Luffy of corruption and misconduct. The article, a vile concoction of lies, was not what she had approved. 

The Valdorian Times has hired you as a cyber incident responder to investigate the incident and determine how the falsified article was published.

Objective:
  - To enhance practical skills using KQL queries.
  - Search for anomalies/unusual behaviour in the logs using KQL.
  - Building a timeline to show how the breach happened.
  - Report writing describing the breach.
  - Provide recommendations on how to avoid breaches in the future.

Lessons Learned:
  - Exploring data quickly ‚Äì Using | take 10 is a fast way to inspect table structures and understand what kind of data is available.
  - Filtering and correlating events ‚Äì Queries like where IP == "10.10.0.65" or filtering by distinct helped me narrow down relevant events efficiently.
  - Timeline reconstruction ‚Äì Sorting and combining logs allowed me to see the sequence of attacker actions, showing how they moved through the network.
  - Identifying patterns ‚Äì Using KQL operators like count or distinct helped detect repeated suspicious activities across multiple users and IPs.
  - Report writing, describing the investigation.
  - Hands-on confidence ‚Äì Building queries from scratch reinforced my understanding of how to investigate breaches in a SIEM environment, preparing me for real-world scenarios.
